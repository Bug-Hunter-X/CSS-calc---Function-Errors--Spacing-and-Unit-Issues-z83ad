The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS.  However, if there are spaces around the plus, minus, or multiplication operators, it can lead to unexpected results or errors.  For example, `width: calc(100px + 20px);` works correctly, but `width: calc( 100px + 20px );` may not.  Another common issue is forgetting to close parentheses correctly, or using units inconsistently (mixing px and em, for instance).
